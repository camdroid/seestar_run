REM %TIME% has a leading space instead of a leading zero before 10:00 (e.g.  9:30).
REM This will result in comparisons like "if  9:30 LSS 10:00" which will be false because 9 > 1.
REM A simple workaround for this is to use %TIME: =0% to replace the space with a zero.

REM Without any delays, the loop may consume a lot of CPU.
REM So we can use timeout to sleep for a few seconds between checks.

REM Because it uses string comparison, you can omit trailing 0 values from your time.
REM For example, 09:30:00.00 can be reduced to 09:30 (or even 09:3).
